# DS_Lead-Scoring-CaseStudy

Data:
You have been provided with a leads dataset from the past with around 9000 data points.

Goal:
X Educational institute has appointed you to help them select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers.
The company requires you to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion 
chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.
Logistic Regression Model is used to build the model.
